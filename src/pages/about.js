            <p>This is a choose your own way adventure game. You are an adventurer sent by the guild
            to explore a rookie dungeon. The dungeon is named after an old Demon King named
            Sora. It's your job to make it through the dungeon and find what lies at the
            end of it. Depending on what you find at the end of the dungeon will determine what class
            the guild gives you. Good luck!
